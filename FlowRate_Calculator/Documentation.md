### Inputs and Outputs  
Flow Rate calcualtor calculates volume of water flowing through a canal. It uses Bernoulli's equation to estimate flow underneath a sluice gate in a canal from measurements of water depth upstream and downstream of the gate. Additionaly, force exerted on the gate is calculated from the water depths.  

### Input Variables  
b = canal width  
y1 = upstream water depth  
y2 = downstream water depth  

### Notes   
- The calculator is limited to a canal with dimensions 5m x 5m x 5m. Therefore, the depths and width input can not exceed 5m.  
- dimensions can not be less than or equal to zero
